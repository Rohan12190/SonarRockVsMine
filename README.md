🌊 Sonar Signal Classifier & Interactive Dashboard
An end-to-end machine learning project to classify the source of underwater acoustic signals. This repository contains the complete workflow from data analysis and model experimentation to a fully interactive web dashboard for live predictions.

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to accurately classify sonar signals into one of four sound sources using various machine learning techniques. We begin by establishing a baseline performance with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and then explore more powerful standalone algorithms and stacked ensembles to improve accuracy. The final results and a live prediction tool are presented in a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard.

✨ Key Features
Comprehensive Model Comparison: Benchmarks KNN, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Ensemble Modeling: Investigates the performance of stacking ensembles with KNN as a base learner to test for synergy between models.

In-Depth Analysis: Includes Python scripts for hyperparameter optimization (finding the best K for KNN), detailed error analysis, and performance metric reporting.

Rich Data Visualization: Generates insightful plots for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model comparisons using both Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and R.

Interactive Dashboard: A beautiful and responsive web application built with Streamlit for real-time predictions and viewing results.

📈 Usage
This project has two main components: the analysis scripts that generate results and the Streamlit dashboard that displays them.

1. Running the Analysis and Generating Results
You can regenerate all the reports and visualizations by running the Python scripts from the root directory of the project.

Run the in-depth KNN analysis:

Bash

python new.py
Run the comparison of all standalone and stacked models:

Bash

python run_all_experiments.py
These scripts will populate the results/images and results/reports directories.

2. Launching the Interactive Dashboard
To start the web application, run the following command:

Bash

streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your web browser to view and interact with the dashboard.

📊 Dashboard Preview
The dashboard provides a complete overview of the project through several interactive pages:

Project Overview: Introduces the project goals and displays the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Shows the class distribution and feature correlation matrix.

Model Performance: Displays the final R-generated plots comparing the accuracy of all models.

Live Sonar Prediction: Allows you to input custom feature values using sliders and get a real-time classification from any of the trained models.
